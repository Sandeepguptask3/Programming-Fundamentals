# SQL Statement
  SQL statements tell the database what operation you want to perform on the structured data 
  and what information you would like to access from the database.The statements of SQL are very simple and easy to use and understand. They are like plain English but with a particular syntax.

# Simple Example of SQL statement:

   SELECT "column_name" FROM "table_name";    
   
   Each SQL statement begins with any of the SQL keywords and ends with the semicolon (;). 
   The semicolon is used in the SQL for separating the multiple Sql statements which are going to execute in the same call. 
   In this SQL tutorial, we will use the semicolon (;) at the end of each SQL query or statement.

Let's discuss each statement in short one by one with syntax and one example:



1. SELECT Statement
This SQL statement reads the data from the SQL database and shows it as the output to the database user.

Syntax of SELECT Statement:

SELECT column_name1, column_name2, .…, column_nameN  
    [ FROM table_name ]  
    [ WHERE condition ]  
    [ ORDER BY order_column_name1 [ ASC | DESC ], .... ];  
Example of SELECT Statement:

SELECT Emp_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, City  
FROM Employee_details  
WHERE Salary = 100000  
ORDER BY Last_Name  
This example shows the Emp_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, and City of those employees from the Employee_details table whose Salary is 100000. The output shows all the specified details according to the ascending alphabetical order of Last_Name.


2. UPDATE Statement
This SQL statement changes or modifies the stored data in the SQL database.

Syntax of UPDATE Statement:

UPDATE table_name  
SET column_name1 = new_value_1, column_name2 = new_value_2, ...., column_nameN = new_value_N  
[ WHERE  CONDITION ];  
Example of UPDATE Statement:

UPDATE Employee_details  
SET Salary = 100000  
WHERE Emp_ID = 10;  
This example changes the Salary of those employees of the Employee_details table whose Emp_ID is 10 in the table.




3. DELETE Statement
This SQL statement deletes the stored data from the SQL database.
Syntax of DELETE Statement:

DELETE FROM table_name  
[ WHERE CONDITION ];  
Example of DELETE Statement:

DELETE FROM Employee_details  
WHERE First_Name = 'Sumit';  
This example deletes the record of those employees from the Employee_details table whose First_Name is Sumit in the table.


4. CREATE TABLE Statement
This SQL statement creates the new table in the SQL database.

Syntax of CREATE TABLE Statement:

CREATE TABLE table_name  
(  
column_name1 data_type [column1 constraint(s)],  
column_name2 data_type [column2 constraint(s)],  
.....  
.....,  
column_nameN data_type [columnN constraint(s)],  
PRIMARY KEY(one or more col)  
);  
Example of CREATE TABLE Statement:

CREATE TABLE Employee_details(  
      Emp_Id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,  
      First_name VARCHAR(30),  
      Last_name VARCHAR(30),  
      Salary Money,  
      City VARCHAR(30),  
      PRIMARY KEY (Emp_Id)  
);  
This example creates the table Employee_details with five columns or fields in the SQL database. 
The fields in the table are Emp_Id, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, and City. The Emp_Id column in the 
table acts as a primary key, which means that the Emp_Id column cannot contain duplicate values and null values.





5. ALTER TABLE Statement
This SQL statement adds, deletes, and modifies the columns of the table in the SQL database.

Syntax of ALTER TABLE Statement:

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype[(size)];  
The above SQL alter statement adds the column with its datatype in the existing database table.

ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name column_datatype[(size)];  
The above 'SQL alter statement' renames the old column name to the new column name of the existing database table.

ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;  
The above SQL alter statement deletes the column of the existing database table.


Example of ALTER TABLE Statement:

ALTER TABLE Employee_details   
ADD Designation VARCHAR(18);  
This example adds the new field whose name is Designation with size 18 in the Employee_details table of the SQL database.




6. DROP TABLE Statement
This SQL statement deletes or removes the table and the structure, views, permissions, and triggers associated with that table.

Syntax of DROP TABLE Statement:

DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ]  
table_name1, table_name2, ……, table_nameN;  
The above syntax of the drop statement deletes specified tables completely if they exist in the database.

Example of DROP TABLE Statement:

DROP TABLE Employee_details;   
This example drops the Employee_details table if it exists in the SQL database. This removes the complete information if available in the table.
