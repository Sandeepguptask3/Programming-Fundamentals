#  Q.History of SQL
 ANS-A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" was a paper which was published by the great computer scientist "E.F. Codd" in 1970.
     The IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed the SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) after learning 
     from the paper given by E.F. Codd. They both developed the SQL at the San Jose Research laboratory of IBM Corporation in 1970.
     At the end of the 1970s, relational software Inc. developed their own first SQL using the concepts of E.F. Codd, 
     Raymond Boyce, and Donald Chamberlin. This SQL was totally based on RDBMS. Relational Software Inc., which is now known as Oracle Corporation,
     introduced the Oracle V2 in June 1979, which is the first implementation of SQL language. This Oracle V2 version operates on VAX computers.
     
     
 # Q.Process of SQL
     When we are executing the command of SQL on any Relational database management system, then the system automatically 
     finds the best routine to carry out our request, and the SQL engine determines how to interpret that particular command.

     Structured Query Language contains the following four components in its process:

     1. Query Dispatcher
     2.Optimization Engines
     3.Classic Query Engine
     4.SQL Query Engine, etc.
