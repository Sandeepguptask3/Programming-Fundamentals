# Disadvantages of SQL
 With the advantages of SQL, it also has some disadvantages, which are as follows:

# SQL Syntax
  When you want to do some operations on the data in the database, then you must have to write the query in the predefined syntax of SQL.

  The syntax of the structured query language is a unique set of rules and guidelines, which is not case-sensitive.
  Its Syntax is defined and maintained by the ISO and ANSI standards.

  Following are some most important points about the SQL syntax which are to remember:

 a> You can write the keywords of SQL in both uppercase and lowercase, but writing the SQL keywords in uppercase improves the readability of the SQL query.
 b> SQL statements or syntax are dependent on text lines. We can place a single SQL statement on one or multiple text lines.
 c> You can perform most of the action in a database with SQL statements.
 d> SQL syntax depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
